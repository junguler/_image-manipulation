## what is needed to get started?
Triangula is a gui and cli program that takes your image(s) make cool looking triangular and polygonal art out of them. find the github repo [here for gui](https://github.com/RH12503/triangula) and [here for cli](https://github.com/RH12503/Triangula-CLI) the cli version does not come pre-comiled and you have to install golang and compile it yourself, i'll include the linux binary i've made for myself in this repo and if you have a macos or windows binary contact me to include it as well, i also started an issue in the cli repo and we might get and official build as well

## source material
everything is downloaded from a royalty free image website [here](https://free-images.com/)

## gui version
there is a gui version available with simplified usage [here](https://github.com/RH12503/triangula/releases/tag/v1.2.0) while perfectly usable i'm more interested in the cli version as we want to be able to re-produce same types of results automatically and batch convert them
