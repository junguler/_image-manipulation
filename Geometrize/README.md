## what is needed to get started?
Geometrize is a cli and gui program that takes your input image(s) make cool looking art with them using basic shapes, find the github page [here](https://github.com/Tw1ddle/geometrize) for gui, [here](https://github.com/Tw1ddle/geometrize-lib-example) for cli,
unlike primitive geometrize come with a binary executable for cli and gui out of the box, find them [here](https://www.geometrize.co.uk/) for gui and [here](https://s3.amazonaws.com/geometrize-lib-example-bucket/index.html) for the cli

## what are the differences betwwen primitives and geometrize?
from the first look these two programs might look familiar but there are enough differences to not consider geometrize just a re-write and i'll try to point some of thme here
 * geometrize was inspired by primitives
 * geometrize was written in C and C++ bht primitives was written in golang
 * geometerize comes with gui and cli version for windows, linux and ios but primitves only has a gui version for ios (it's multiplatform on the cli)
 * geometrize allows you to combine different shapes together but primitives does not, it has a combo mode for using all available shapes tho
 * geometrize gives you more control for opacity of each shape and number of candidate shapes to go thru before deciding a shape, it's more accurate but slower than primitives 

since there are similarities between the two programs i try to focus on the difference geometrize has to primitives and focus more on combining different shapes and only show new things geometrize has
