## ebsynth(gui)
ebsynth is a gui program that takes 1 or few images as style and applies them to an image sequence, unlike other style transfer programs ebsynth tries to stay as close to the source materaial as possible, you can find the beta version of the software from their website [here](https://ebsynth.com/) unfortunently there is no linux version available at the moment and the release version is meant to be a paid product but we still have access to the beta version for free on windows and mac os
